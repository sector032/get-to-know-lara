# Get to know Lara

## Story

One of your friends suggested that you should get to know Lara well, but you misunderstood and started to learn Laravel, a popular framework for the Web.
You realized your mistake but want to finish what you started...

It's an email application based on Laravel backend and React frontend!

## How to run?

## Frontend

After you opened the repository, run "npm install". If it's installed all of the dependencies, use: "npm start" command!

## Backend

First use "composer install" command to install all dependencies.
There is a .env.example file in the repository. You need to copy it and delete the ".example" part. After that please fill the following rows:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql<br>
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1<br>
DB_PORT=3306<br>
DB_DATABASE=laravel<br>
DB_USERNAME=root<br>
DB_PASSWORD=<br>

After that use "php artisan migrate" command, if its done use "php artisan serve" command to run the application.

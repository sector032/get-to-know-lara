# Get to know Lara

## Story

One of your friends suggested that you should get to know Lara well, but you misunderstood and started to learn Laravel, a popular framework for the Web.
You realized your mistake but want to finish what you started...

It's an email application based on Laravel backend and React frontend!

## How to run?

## Frontend

After you opened the repository, run "npm install". If it's installed all of the dependencies, use: "npm start" command!

## Backend

First use "composer install" command to install all dependencies.
There is a .env.example file in the repository. You need to copy it and delete a .example. After that please fill the following rows:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

After that use "php artisan migrate" command, if its done use "php artisan serve" command to run the application.
